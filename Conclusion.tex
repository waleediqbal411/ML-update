\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have performed an in-depth bibliometric study of the publication trends in machine learning literature using article content and metadata of four important machine learning periodicals---International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), and SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD)---gathered over the time period 2004--2018.  Our work extends the state of the art in bibliometric analysis of machine learning literature by presented comprehensive analyses that shed light on the publication patterns in these venues including which kinds of articles are published where; how are journal and conference publications different in this area; and which different authors, institutes, and countries have been successful in these venues (and how). We believe that our analyses provide an insightful look into the publication culture in the machine learning community and can help develop a more nuanced understanding of this research field especially in the light of the limited existing bibliometric work that focused on the machine learning community. In this regard, we have also publicly shared our dataset that includes content, metadata, and citation-related information related to the articles published from 2004 to 2018 in ICML, JMLR, NeurIPS, and KDD as our contribution to the research community. \footnote{link to be shared}.
